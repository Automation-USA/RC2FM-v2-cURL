# RC2FM2-cURL
RC2FM2-cURL is a complete re-write of our server-side RingCentral app (https://t.co/XzKvvUs3A9) integration for the Claris FileMaker platform that we are releasing as fully open-source.
 
We have ported all of the backend PHP code for RC2FM Connector into 100% native FileMaker scripts and cURL commands, making the functionality of our RingCentral™ API integration available as open source for all FileMaker users to use. All you require is a RingCentral® subscription, a free RingCentral® developer account, and your own RingCentral integration app.
